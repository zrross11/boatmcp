# BoatMCP TODO List

## High Priority Features

### LLM-Powered Analysis & Generation
- [ ] **Refactor Scanner/Analyzer**: Replace rule-based project analysis with LLM-based understanding
  - Integrate mlx-community package from HuggingFace for local LLM inference
  - Read all files within a given path and send to LLM context window for comprehensive analysis
  - Use LLM to detect project type, language, framework, dependencies, and deployment requirements
- [ ] **LLM-Generated Dockerfiles**: Refactor Dockerfile generation to use LLM recommendations
  - Replace template-based generation with intelligent LLM-powered creation
  - LLM should analyze codebase and generate optimized Dockerfiles based on actual code patterns
- [ ] **LLM-Generated Helm Charts**: Refactor Helm chart generation to use LLM recommendations
  - Replace template-based generation with intelligent LLM-powered creation
  - LLM should understand application architecture and generate appropriate Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] **Smart Retry Mechanism**: Implement intelligent retry for LLM generations when workflow steps fail
  - MCP server should detect downstream failures and retry LLM generation with failure context
  - Learn from failures to improve subsequent generation attempts

### Container Image Management
- [ ] **Image Loading Function**: Create a new function to load Docker images into minikube
  - Should support loading from local Docker daemon into minikube
  - Later generalize to support uploading to container registries (DockerHub, ECR, GCR, etc.)
  - Include error handling for image loading failures

### Minikube Profile Management
- [ ] **Profile Switching**: Ensure that when creating a minikube cluster, the profile is switched to the correct profile
  - Automatically switch context to the newly created cluster
  - Verify the profile is active after creation
  - Handle cases where profile switching fails

## Medium Priority Features

### Deployment Workflows
- [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment**: Add functions to deploy applications to minikube clusters
- [ ] **Helm Chart Generation**: Generate Helm charts for applications
- [ ] **Service Management**: Create, update, and delete Kubernetes services
- [ ] **Ingress Configuration**: Set up ingress controllers and rules

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Templates**: Generate CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimize Docker builds with multi-stage patterns
- [ ] **Build Caching**: Implement Docker layer caching strategies

## Low Priority Features

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints to deployed applications
- [ ] **Logging Configuration**: Set up centralized logging for deployed apps
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**: Integrate Prometheus metrics collection

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Secure handling of application secrets
- [ ] **RBAC Configuration**: Role-based access control for Kubernetes deployments
- [ ] **Network Policies**: Implement network segmentation policies

## Infrastructure Improvements

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Improve error reporting with actionable suggestions
- [ ] **Rollback Capabilities**: Add rollback functionality for failed deployments
- [ ] **Validation**: Pre-deployment validation of configurations

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Parallel Operations**: Execute independent operations in parallel
- [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Optimize resource allocation for containers
- [ ] **Build Speed**: Improve Docker build times with better caching

- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document all MCP tool functions
- [ ] **Example Workflows**: Create comprehensive example deployment scenarios
- [ ] **Video Tutorials**: Create video guides for common use cases

### Testing
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test complete deployment workflows
- [ ] **Mock Services**: Create mock services for testing without real infrastructure
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Test deployment performance under load
