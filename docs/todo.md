# BoatMCP TODO List

## High Priority Features

### Container Image Management
- [ ] **Image Loading Function**: Create a new function to load Docker images into minikube
  - Should support loading from local Docker daemon into minikube
  - Later generalize to support uploading to container registries (DockerHub, ECR, GCR, etc.)
  - Include error handling for image loading failures

### Minikube Profile Management
- [ ] **Profile Switching**: Ensure that when creating a minikube cluster, the profile is switched to the correct profile
  - Automatically switch context to the newly created cluster
  - Verify the profile is active after creation
  - Handle cases where profile switching fails

## Medium Priority Features

### Deployment Workflows
- [ ] **Kubernetes Deployment**: Add functions to deploy applications to minikube clusters
- [ ] **Helm Chart Generation**: Generate Helm charts for applications
- [ ] **Service Management**: Create, update, and delete Kubernetes services
- [ ] **Ingress Configuration**: Set up ingress controllers and rules

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Templates**: Generate CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimize Docker builds with multi-stage patterns
- [ ] **Build Caching**: Implement Docker layer caching strategies

## Low Priority Features

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints to deployed applications
- [ ] **Logging Configuration**: Set up centralized logging for deployed apps
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**: Integrate Prometheus metrics collection

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Secure handling of application secrets
