# BoatMCP TODO List

## High Priority Features

### LLM-Powered Analysis & Generation
- [ ] **Refactor Scanner/Analyzer**: Replace rule-based project analysis with LLM-based understanding
  - Integrate mlx-community package from HuggingFace for local LLM inference
  - Read all files within a given path and send to LLM context window for comprehensive analysis
  - Use LLM to detect project type, language, framework, dependencies, and deployment requirements
- [ ] **LLM-Generated Dockerfiles**: Refactor Dockerfile generation to use LLM recommendations
  - Replace template-based generation with intelligent LLM-powered creation
  - LLM should analyze codebase and generate optimized Dockerfiles based on actual code patterns
- [ ] **LLM-Generated Helm Charts**: Refactor Helm chart generation to use LLM recommendations
  - Replace template-based generation with intelligent LLM-powered creation
  - LLM should understand application architecture and generate appropriate Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] **Smart Retry Mechanism**: Implement intelligent retry for LLM generations when workflow steps fail
  - MCP server should detect downstream failures and retry LLM generation with failure context
  - Learn from failures to improve subsequent generation attempts

### Container Image Management
- [ ] **Registry Upload**: Generalize image loading to support uploading to container registries (DockerHub, ECR, GCR, etc.)

## Medium Priority Features
